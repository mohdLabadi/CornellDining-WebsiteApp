* Our web app is a forum for Cornell students to review dining halls on campus. It allows users to leave ratings and reviews for different dining halls, as well as check reviews left by other users. The main page shows a gallery of the various dining halls on campus, with their respective average rating, and users can click on a dining hall to view all the reviews left for it. The entry form page allows users to add a rating and review.

## Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
